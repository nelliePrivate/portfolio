            <p>Each of these projects have a link in the Nellie's Noodles Homepage.  My very first team project and voyage with Chingu was a Code Quiz. <br />
            Before entering the voyage, prospective Chingu's must produce a solo project they have created on their own.  For voyage 10, I created the javascript Match game.<br />
            For voyage 15 I made a Google Fonts Clone, and our team created a full stack app named Code Track.  I developed the backend with Django, and the amazing front end made it all beautiful.<br />
            A user can create an account, and make use of the 'to-do' list, the 'bookmarks' to store their favorite links, and the 'goals' where they can set goals for themselves whenever they want.</p>

            <h2> A Chingu Facilitator since January 2020 </h2>
            <image class="image_cell" src="{% static 'images/CSS_v1.GIF' %}" alt="Based on the series Doctor Who, the player is a tardis, an old time public police call box from the 50s, and the enemys are red black and gold Daleks, the most hateful and deadly of Doctor Who villians."></image>
            <p class="info">
                As a facilitator and voyager, I am a proud supporter of the Chingu experience.  Being on a team, and building projects really helped me to explore and develop my coding abilities beyond what I would have been able to on my own.
                <br />
                In the facilitator role I get the chance to evaluate sumbissions for voyage entry, and recently was on a team to build a game demo and guidelines to add to the many amazing projects Chingu offers new entrants to build.
                <br />
                I built a small collision demo in Vanilla JavaScript while creating our game examples, the link will be below.  A gif of one of the examples I built is above.

            <image class="image_cell enlarge-bg" src="{% static 'images/wiwa.JPG' %}" alt="a screenshot of a silly conversation with my chatbot, Wiwa."></image>


            <p class="info">
                Whispering Wall, or Wiwa for short, is a chatbot built with python.  <br />The NLTK library is utilized to parse user entered text, and separate identified parts of speech into lists.<br />
                Once all the cleaning and parsing is done, One of the parsed parts of speech is selected at random. <br />
                A script that has sentences set up to fit that part of speech is also selected randomly to return to the user.<br />
                If the code can't detect an English word, a script of silly phrases (Most from Monty Python) is used, and a random selection comes from there.<br />
                She also can respond to her own name, greetings, my name, questions, simple answers, and I have recently added a list of words she will not tolerate being used in the chatbox.
                Go have a chat! It's just sillyness, I promise.

                This is my first and personal web page, Nellie's Noodles. <br /> It is run on a pythonanywhere server using Django, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br />
                There's a chatbot, a silly javascript example of a tardis in ASCII, a tiny game meant for two players called NIM, my small blog about the site, A wordfinder that can spellcheck and retrieve definitions.
                I've used this site to experiment with a slackbot, a math site, a trading site, and a few other projects that got lost along the way.
